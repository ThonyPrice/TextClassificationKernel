## Description

Course work for DD2424 - Advanced Machine Learning. As a group project, we stuidied the paper of [String subsequence kernel (SSK) for text classification and its approximation](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume2/lodhi02a/lodhi02a.pdf) and conducted our own experiments to verify the results. We also compared it to other kernels such as approximative SSK (ASSK), N-gram kernel (NGK) and word kernel (WK).

## Abstract

This report builds upon an earlier paper: String subsequence kernel (SSK) for text classification and its approximation [1]. We have made a close study of the original report and by our own implementation re- produced some of the results which consist of text classification on the dataset Reuters-21578 [4] using different kernels for text classification. In particular, the report focuses on describing the SSK and an approxima- tion of the SSK kernel presented in the original paper but also presents the fundamentals for two other text classification kernels, n-grams, and word kernel.

The report contains results of testing each kernel as implemented by the authors. The SSK and approximated SSK was found significantly computational heavy and therefore were not run on the same amount of data as the original report or the other kernels making it hard to compare its performance against those presented in the original article. The n- grams and word kernel were run successfully and match results from the original article.
